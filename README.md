# JaimerBlog

A blog built using [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for Jaime Ellenberger, author extraordinaire and a dear friend.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
