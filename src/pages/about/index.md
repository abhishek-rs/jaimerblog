### Background

Jaime Ellenberger was born in Scottdale, Pennsylvania in the United States on October 26, 1995. She grew up there with her mom, dad, brother, and dog about an hour outside of Pittsburgh. Growing up, Jaime played sports, did ballet, and learned the saxophone. She grew up surrounded by family, reading, music, and love. 

### Education

Ellenberger attended Penn State Univeristy at the main campus in State College, Pennsylvania from 2014-2018. She earned a degree in Elementary and Early Childhood Education, minor in Spanish, and English as a Second Language Certification. While there, Ellenberger worked at Schlow Centre Region Library in their children's department and the Intensive English Communication Program run by Penn State. 

Jaime did part of her student teaching in Atenas, Alajuela, Costa Rica for several months at Atenas Preescolar y Escuela Colina Azul. She taught English to Pre-K-Grade 4.

Since then, Ellenberger continues to take courses online related to education, language learning, and writing.

### Work

Since graduating from Penn State in 2018, Ellenberger has been working at Internationella Engelska Skolan (IES) in Stockholm, Sweden. She has taught English, art, and textiles in her three years at the company. The schools operate in English, but Jaime also takes Swedish language courses provided by the government. She teaches grades 4 and 5.

### Goals

In the near future, Jaime would like to continue living in Stockholm, become fluent in Swedish, teach English, write short stories and articles when she isn't teaching, and travel on her breaks from school. More long term goals would be traveling year round, writing daily, and teaching English online.
