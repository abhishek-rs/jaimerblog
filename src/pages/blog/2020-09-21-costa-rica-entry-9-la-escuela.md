> **"One student, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world." -Malala Yousafzai**

Walking through the green, iron gate. Entering through the openness of the classroom. Hugging my students in the preschool. Hiking up the hill on the cement pavement, feeling mosquitos bothering my ankles and plants brushing my skirt. Turning the corner to come face to face with an iguana the size of my arm. A friendly "¡buenas días!" to staff and students. A surreal moment gazing out into the mountains with the clouds rolling in. Birds singing in the trees in front of me.

Atenas Preescolar and Escuela Colina Azul has been my new environment for the past 5 weeks. I've been working there teaching English to Pre Kínder (ages 3-4), Kínder (ages 4-5), Prepatoría (ages 5-6), 1st grade, and 2nd grade daily, and tutoring 4th, 5th, and 6th graders on Friday afternoons. I only have one more week in the school (time has FLOWN by I can't believe that it's soon time for me to leave this amazing family and beautiful country) and I have a feeling I'll be shedding a few tears on my last day. Early today I began writing my thank yous to the teachers and made little cards for the students. I hate thinking that I will have to say goodbye, and that I will never be able to see these incredible kids ever again. I won't get to see what they grow up to be. I won't get to know the new things they learned and how their interests have changed. That is the hardest part about all of the schools I've been in so far: I know the students for a short amount of time, we develop an amazing relationship, then it's time for me to go and I don't get to see them again. Even though it is great because I get to know so many awesome kids in a short amount of time, I'm excited to find a school that I'll be at for years and get to watch the students grow as I grow with them.

For my English classes with 1st and 2nd grade, I co-taught with another student teacher here, Lauren, for my first 4 weeks. The last two weeks I have been on my own with teaching and planning and luckily have help from my incredible 2nd grade mentor teacher Julie (and I graciously accepted an offer for a ride everyday from my amazing Prepa mentor teacher, Maricela), and I've already learned so much! This last week in 2nd grade, we read some stories about Art and PE Class and got to share our own experiences within those subjects, and (of course) answer some questions about what we read. The students were DYING to participate and read which always makes for a fun and engaging class! This group of 19 is EXTREMELY talkative and looks like they aren't paying attention or are getting distracted, but believe it or not, they are learning! I will actually miss the chaotic atmosphere of that tiny classroom filled to the brim with 8 year olds.

As fun and crazy as second grade is, I ABSOLUTELY ADORE MY 3-6 YEAR OLDS IN THE PRESCHOOL. They include some of the most intelligent, kind hearted, and happiest kids I've ever met in my life. They make me feel so loved and ecstatic to be a teacher that I wish I could teach them all day! After I teach 2nd grade, I work with the bilingual principal to teach English vocabulary and phrases to the youngest students of the school. We dance, and sing, and have a lot of fun! In the afternoons I am with them for nap time and help to create science, math, and English centers for the students. At first, I didn't know how I would like to work with the younger students, especially because when I first got here I didn't know how to use a lot of my Spanish and they don't know much English. But this perceived "problem" at first has turned into such a great advantage for our communication skills (for both the students and me). We use images, find other ways to say or explain something, model and act things out, use our faces to help us portray what we need or how we are feeling. It's such a beautiful thing. For the most part, these kids are no different than the kids in the United States and I'm sure everywhere else in the world: they cry when something breaks, they laugh when they are with a friend, they learn how to treat each other, they learn how to love, they want to give hugs, they learn how to make friends, they learn what to do if someone is mean to them, they like to color and act out stories, they love to dab and do that weird dancing backpack kid dance. All of these seem to be universal (like, even dabbing? really?!) for kids. And yes, this probably seems really obvious. But these students also have a lot of differences (and remember my only other experience is in the United States so that is where I will be comparing to). First, they are pretty much conversationally bilingual by the time they are in 2nd or 3rd grade (or younger depending on if their parents speak English or if they use English anywhere outside of school). And of course, they will have cultural differences and various views on life, but everyone does! Every culture will! That's what makes the world so beautiful. It is no different than anywhere else in the world. They all want to do their best. They all want to learn. And I am SO overjoyed that I get to help them do just that.

​Here are some pictures of my Prepa classroom in the preschool part of the school. Such a welcoming, open, trusting place. I am incredibly lucky to be able to work with such a kind, generous, helpful, and supportive teacher with these students, Maricela! The kids love being with her just as much as I do!
