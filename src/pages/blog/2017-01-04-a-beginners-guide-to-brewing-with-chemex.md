  This was my first blog post ever written on my old Weebly account. It was
  created back in April of 2018, when I  began my student teaching abroad in
  Costa Rica. I wanted a place to keep all of my memories and experiences and
  have it all be in one place. 


  I haven't changed anything in the writing. Everything is how I wrote it in 2018.

Tomorrow is the day that will change my life forever.\
\
I will travel to Costa Rica to teach English for two months as part of my student teaching practicum.\
\
The last year was full of preparation and list making, especially this past week. Packing has been, as usual, a stressful activity. Am I bringing too much? Am I bringing too little? What if I need another skirt? Should I bring this one item that no one would ever need for anything ever? OF COURSE I SHOULD EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NO ROOM FOR IT.\
\
Somehow my checked bags are under 40 lbs. Still trying to figure out how that happened.\
\
Usually I would be buying a one-way ticket to Anxietyville on the hot mess express, but I am surprisingly more excited than nervous! This is my first time to fully immerse myself in a new culture, new food, new school systems, and new people! I can't spend it being antisocial and afraid to try new things.\

I believe Mark Twain was right when he said, "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover." And that is exactly what I plan on doing.
