  It's so interesting to go back and read work that I've done a few years back. Rereading these entries is reminding me just how awesome my trip to Costa Rica was.

### "It's never too late in life to have a genuine adventure." -Robert Kurson

\
Today I learned two things: don't flush the toilet paper and my host family has roosters.\
\
But of course, I learned a lot more as the day went on.\
\
This morning the other student teachers and I met our consultant at a local restaurant/café for breakfast. We met with an American who had been living in Costa Rica for the last 14 years or so. In two weeks he is taking us to a nearby island (a four hour drive and a boat ride) to see the sea turtles, or *baulas*, lay their eggs! I nearly fell out of my chair and my eyes practically popped out of my head when he then said we would get to go up to them, safely of course, and hold onto her flippers as she is laying them.\
\
This American/Tico (Ticos are what locals are called) met with us to discuss the history of the trip, what to bring, and what to expect. I will write more about that when we actually get to experience it!\
\
The guy who is arranging this for us, Paul, was very passionate, proud, and inspirational. I think that is why we stayed at the restaurant for nearly three hours talking with him! There were even a few times where he got emotional because of how passionate he is about helping others, animals, the environment, and the community. He told us that your work should be creative and productive and inspirational, not something you hate going to and don't like. He encouraged us all to follow this passion of teaching we all hold inside of us and I have never felt more sure of my profession.\
\
​Once we got back from that, I practiced in my room that I share with Lauren on how to ask when my host family wanted to be paid....yes, I practiced that. Actually the first thing I did when I woke up this morning was make sure I knew how to say "I slept well," and "The bed is comfortable," so that I didn't walk outside and had my mouth open like a trout going "uhhhh, si???" and nodding my head profusely.

After this, one of my students (and host parent's granddaughter) that lives next door came over to play. I was able to talk to her a little bit in Spanish. Even though the Ticos are so patient with you when trying to speak Spanish, kids are so much more easy to talk to! Actually, I feel that way in the United States, too!! We both had our hair done in two braids and she was very excited to see that our hair was *lo mismo*, or the same. I video chatted with my dad and the little 4 year old came into my room and asked me who I was talking to. She was able to introduce herself to my dad through my phone (*en español*) and she was very proud of her name! It was so adorable, and I am extremely excited to work with these students more in the upcoming weeks!\
\
Lauren and I went to a local café to do some work in the afternoon. We walked about 7 or 8 minutes away to a really nice café that has smoothies, coffees, and lots of food options. We were able to bounce lesson plan ideas off each other and talked about what our future holds for us both back in the states and opportunities abroad.\
\
As I lay here in bed, I feel extremely lucky. I was lucky enough to receive a scholarship through Penn State's Alumni Association to fund this ENTIRE trip for me. I am certainly going to put the money to good use here. Even though I have only been here for a few days, I feel so comfortable. The Tico lifestyle is definitely one I could get used to.\
