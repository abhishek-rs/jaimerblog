Yes! That is actually me! I only got up and rode the entire way to the shore once, but that was my only goal- to stand up on the surfboard!\
\
Wednesday, April 11th, we had a day off of school to celebrate and remember Juan Santamaría, a national hero to the country of Costa Rica. He died on April 11th, 1856. This was the day of the Second Battle at Rivas in Nicaragua.\
\
A confederate from The United States named William Walker organized several private military expeditions into Latin America so he could personally establish them as English-speaking colonies under his own control.\
\
He overtook Nicaragua and ruled there for about a year. He tried to overtake Costa Rica as well, but troops battled with him at Rivas, Nicaragua. Santamaría gave his life in order to set fire to the hostels where Walker's men were. This is why he is celebrated on this day. He helped to save the country from being run by Walker and forced under his rule.\
\
Of course, we didn't learn about this in the United States since the bad guy was the American. Even some of the students here in Costa Rica recognized this problem with people not learning the truth within history and not learning about the bad parts.\
\
The sixth graders in the elementary school actually reenacted this battle the day before the holiday (since we didn't have school on the actual day). They told the history of Walker and Santamaría, the battle, and what it meant for Costa Ricans. I'm so glad they did this (even though it was very difficult for me to follow because they did it in Spanish!) because I wouldn't have known about this otherwise. That's one of the things I really love about teaching- your students teach you just as much as you teach them.

Because we had the day off, the other student teachers and I travelled with another teacher from our school to Jacó, a beach city on the Pacific side of Costa Rica. We passed a bridge you could walk over and look down into a river where there were several crocodiles swimming and laying the in the mud and grass. They. Were. HUGE. I hated walking by the edge of the guard rail because it wasn't very big but those crocodile's teeth sure were.\

When we got to the beach I saw the the sand was black, the air was cool, the sun was absent, and the beaches were deserted. Not what you'd think a typical beach in Costa Rica would look like!\
\
This is were I mustered up the courage to go surfing. It has been on my bucket list ever since I first made it years and years ago. I'm so proud of myself for even just trying and putting myself out there. I am always so worried about what others think, but this time, I let those negative thoughts go and let myself have the time of my life!

We paid the equivalent of $40 (USD) and got to surf for about three hours! The instructor was extremely kind and luckily (for me) bilingual. He gave us shirts to wear, clay-like sunscreen for our faces, and a mini lesson on how to lay on the board and stand up on it before we got in the water. I knew I was in for an adventure when I could barely stand up correctly on the board on land let alone in the water! People make it look so easy!!\
\
We took our surfboards into the ocean and surprisingly the instructor took me first as soon as we got out there (probably because it was apparent I needed the most assistance and all the practice I could get!). Needless to say, the first few hours were very repetitive of me swallowing gulps of salt water and giving myself brush burns on my knees!\
\
Before our last few tries, we had a mini break on the shore. The instructor helped guide me through an easier way to stand up on the board (since I clearly have no upper body or core strength whatsoever). He was super helpful and never gave up on me!\
\
After a few more tries, I surfed the entire way to the shore and I could hear the instructor cheering for me from out in the waves! I was so incredibly happy that I had finally done it I couldn't wait to go try again! It honestly felt like you were just flying over the waves. The breeze felt amazing, and I honestly don't remember much else because I think I was so shocked that I finally did it.\
\
When I got back out in the water, the instructor gave me the biggest, tightest hug I have ever gotten from anyone and said that I was his champion and warrior because I never gave up! For someone who was so nervous about trying something new, that meant the world to me to hear!\
\
If you have been wanting to do something, go for it! ¡La pura vida! Don't worry about what other people think, because it could stop you from doing something great and something you might love. You better believe that the next time I go to a beach I am finding a surf board to try again. When you get an opportunity, especially one this amazing, you need to take it.\

Below are some pictures I took of the beach and some our teacher friend took of me catching some totally gnarly waves, brah.
